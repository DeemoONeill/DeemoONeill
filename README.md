### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chemist with a passion for data and python development. 

My recent projects are: 
- Converting 2D NMR data into a 3D printable model (Python)
- Firefox addons to solve some pain points I have with webapps I use regularly (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Python class to solve a particular set of thermodynamics problems 
- Discord bots for DnD and other games (Python)

Currently trying to get my JavaScript skills up to scratch, starting with vanilla and looking towards a framework like Svelte and/or React. Also trying to get my head around flexbox and grid for web layouts.
